# 2.4GHz Minimal Tx

Very Small 2.4GHz eLRS Module to fit INTO the Jumper T-Lite or other Transmitters.

### PCB manufacturing

Upload the Gerber file to https://jlcpcb.com/RAT.  Check the price for 5, 10, and 30 pieces.  It is sometimes cheaper to order 30 than 10 and only a minor increase in price compared to 5.

*PCB Thickness: 1mm*

### Build order

- Solder the WROOM32 module
- Solder the 10k resistor
- Solder the capacitor
- Flash firmware to the Module to see if the ESP32 works fine (Connect an FTDI to the GND=GND, 3.3=3,3V, TX=RX, RX=TX, B=GND pins on the left header and flash the DIY_2400_TX_ESP32_SX1280_E28_via_UART build in pio/eLRS Configurator )
- Solder the e28 module. Dont forget to change the zero ohm resistor near the ufl.  Default is to use the PCB antenna, it must be repositioned to use the ufl.
- Connect GND and 3,3 from the modules 3-pin header to the S7V8F3 regulators GND and VOUT.
- Connect GND and VIN from the regulator and SP from the module to the modul-bay connector of the Jumper T-Lite.

UNCONFIRMED: It might be possible to connect SHDN from the regulator to the module bays VOUT and VIN from the regulator directly to the battery + side. So the regulator is powered directly by the battery, but only enabled if the module is selected by OpenTX. By doing this you will be able to draw more current for running the module at higher output power, but it might drain the battery over very long time even if the remote is shut down. But this option needs some more investigation, i guess the pullup on the SHDN pin needs to be removed and maybe replaced by a pulldown. 

**Please check the temperature of the module, i added a small heatsink to both sides (ESP32 and SX1280 module) i had lying around from my raspberry pi - just to be on the save side.**

### STLs

- Print the 2nd Antenna Mount for the Jumper T-Lite, TPU worked perfect for me as it keeps it a bit flexible. Angled pigtail for the ELRS antenna goes into the bottom hole (cut a small slot into the T-Lite case to put the cable through), T-Lite antenna trough the center hole, 2 small screws are used to fix it on the two mounting holes of the T-Lite. Front ring can be used to clip on a strap.
